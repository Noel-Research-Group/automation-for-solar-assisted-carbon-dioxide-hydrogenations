    Information about known devices is stored in a json formatted file accessed via the load() and save() methods.
    To configure new devices, run interactive_serial_scan() while the devices are connected (or run for each device),
    to assign them a name and store identifiers.

    Once the devices are configured, simply:
        known_devices = KnownDevices()
        comport = known_devices[device_name]

    Devices are currently identified by serial_number, vid (vendor ID), pid (product ID), manufacturer and custom ID.
    If a device does not specify some of these parameters, the script will only match devices which also do not specify
    the same parameter.
    Custom IDs can be programmed into the devices themselves to distinguish between otherwise identical devices, but the
    matching process is slower as a serial connection must be opened to read the custom ID. Custom IDs should be set
    only when necessary."""
