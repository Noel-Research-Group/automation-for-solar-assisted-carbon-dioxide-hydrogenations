# Controller for automated Variable Backpressure Regulator

Device for automated control of backpressure in a flow setup.
This repo includes data on the construction of the physiscal device, code for the Arduino UNO controller
and documentation on controlling the device via serial-through-USB.

More detailed information is available via the documentation in the doc folder.

# Controller connections

### Stepper driver
- PIN\_2 -> Stepper driver ENABLE (active low)
- PIN\_3 -> Stepper driver DIRECTION
- PIN\_4 -> Stepper driver PULSE (active low)

### Analog inputs
- PIN\_14 (A0) <- Analog input, reads multi-turn potentiometer for absolute position of valve.
- PIN\_15 (A1) <- Analog input, reads pressure via the current-to-voltage conversion circuit.

# Serial Communication

The device is controlled via serial-through-USB using human readable commands with the following syntax:

- `Sx=y`<br>
Set variable x to value y. Variable numbers are integer, values type depends on the variable.<br>
- `Rx`<br>
Read variable x and print its value to serial.<br>

If y is a string, commands must be terminated with a newline character, if not, another commands can follow directly.
Unrecognized characters are silently ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands are sent as 'write only' variables. If the argument type is `NONE`, the command should be issued in the form `Sx=` without any argument.
